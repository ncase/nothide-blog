**Nothing to Hide, Nothing to Fear:** a surveillance state survival horror.

A new game project, started literally just this week!
Next week, I'll flesh out the line-of-sight mechanics, but for right now, I've programmed a [Monaco](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC7b6642AWM)-inspired shadow-masking effect.

Please ignore the placeholder catgirl.

I posted this GIF and other screenshots to /r/gamedev in their weekly [Screenshot Saturday thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1naicc/screenshot_saturday_138_27_23_21/ccgux5a).
Out of curiosity, I asked them if they'd like a tutorial on how to make a similar shadow effect.

The response?

Very well! I want to make this game as open and transparent as possible.
Making tutorials and behind-the-scenes posts about once a week would be a good start, I think.
The goal is for everything to be open: its development, its design, even its funding.

Fits the title of *Nothing to Hide*, no?

**P.S:** GIF was recorded using [LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/), an awesome open-source tool.
I would have otherwise resorted to taking 15 screenshots a second and manually turning it into a GIF.
Seriously.
